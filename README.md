### the QualtricsTools project

This is a project I'm working on to automate creating reports from 
Qualtrics survey data and responses. This is an R package that 
comes with a Shiny application that can be used for automatic report generation.

#### installing

To get setup, you'll need to have R or [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools), and [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).

    devtools::install_github("ctesta01/QualtricsTools")
    library(QualtricsTools)
    QualtricsTools::app()

The QualtricsTools Shiny app should now be running! Enjoy!
